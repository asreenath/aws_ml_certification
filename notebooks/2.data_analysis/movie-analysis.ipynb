While some popular online streaming sites famously use _Machine Learning_ to recommend their viewers movies to watch, and that certainly has its use-case, as you can see it can be worth it to first establish some rule-of-thumb recommendations based on data and logic. That's what you now have in these tables you just generated.\n",
